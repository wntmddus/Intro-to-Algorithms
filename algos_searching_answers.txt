1. Given that length of collection size is 26(alphabet counts) and G is located at 7th slot in array
So it would take 7 iteration for linear search algorithm to find the location of G
2. On first iteration it will visit 13th slot then 6th slot on next then 9th then 7th
so it will take binary search to find the slot in 4 iterations
3. fib(10) 34+55=89
fib(11) 55+89=144
fib(12) 89+144=233

In the benchmark, it shows that iterative fibonacci is a lot faster than recursive Fibonacci

user     system      total        real
recursive fibonacci   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001688)
iterative fibonacci   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000013)

1. In the given list of 1 million unsorted items in array, I believe linear search is a lot efficient to
approach to problem, and search method must be designed iteratively

2. In the given list of 1 million sorted items in array, binary search is a lot efficient to approach,
and search should be designed iteratively to efficiently go through.
